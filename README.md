# neo4j Annotation Engine

This engine is designed to run in a docker container for deployment portability & to facilitate reproducibility among collaborators.  The intention of this engine is to provide a platform for credentialed crowd-sourcing of scientific records and publications without requiring underlying data resources to manage additional unstructured data.  Annotations should follow the [WC3 Web Annotation](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) protocols and follow a model that supports API first development.  As such, this database is in fact composed of two distinct elements, a database, built using `neo4j`, and an API built using node/express.

This repository contains the raw code for the `neo4j` Docker container, test data for populating the database, database scripts for the database schema and constraints, and helper cypher scripts.
