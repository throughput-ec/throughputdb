# Snapshots

The snapshot is a zip archive of the neo4j databases `graph.db` file.  The database can be created locally by replacing the existing `graph.db` folder (in your `$NEO4J/data/databases` folder) with the contents of the zip file.

Once this is complete you should be able to restart the database and have a copy of the Throughput Neo4j database representing the date the snapshot was created.
